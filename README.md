# Interactive-Web

## Description

The purpose and motivation of this project was to use javasript and html to produce a webpage that would show the microbes that colonize human navels. The web page allowed us to create interactive visuals that model that microbe data. Additionally, it allowed us to store all test subjects in a dropdown menu so that we could instantly produce different visuals for each subject.

## Usage

Please visit the [Bellybutton Biodiversity](https://truthprice.github.io/interactive-web) web page to see the visuals.

Select a test subject from the dropdown menu to view the data for that person.
